# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
As part of PyBer Analytics team, we have been requested to perform an analysis to determine how to maximize the profitability of the firm.
This will be done by summarizing the ride-sharing data by city type as well as by creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

As shown in this summary the rural type of city is the one that provides the least number of Rides but also the one with the highest average fare.

Also we can notice that as the number of rides increases the average fare per driver decreases. We should consider paying more attention to the suburban areas since with less drivers has a better average fare than urban cities.

With this graphic it is pretty clear that urban city type has a more stable trend that the other two types, this might be the reason there are more drivers in this kind of city, on the otherhand rural and suburban type of cities have some peaks over time, probably some seasonalities or specific events that changed the Total Fares perceived. 



## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. Increase the participation on Suburban cities, this kind of city has a better performance considering that with less than 500 drivers you are perceiving almost half of what was perceived on urban cities, which have almost 5 times more drivers than suburban cities. 

2. Consider seasonalities to take the most out of these events. This may have a bigger impact for suburban and rural areas where we can notices that on specific dates there were more rides than the usual. PyBer can have a better profitability if we are better prepared for a higher demand of rides.

3. As part of an expansion PyBer can consider to explor more rural cities, as per the info shown this is the kind of cities with the highest average fare per ride, there might be more market to be explore in this kind of cities where we don't have as many drivers as in the rest.
